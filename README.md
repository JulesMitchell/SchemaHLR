Mitchell et al. (2024). Early adaptive schemas, emotional regulation, and cognitive flexibility in eating disorders: subtype specific predictors of eating disorder symptoms using hierarchical linear regression

The code provided applies the HLR package (https://github.com/teanijarv/HLR) to a cross-sectional dataset of self-reported early adaptive schemas, emotional regulation, and cognitive flexibility in eating disorders. 
The code is structured according to diagnostic sub-type (and lack thereof (i.e healthy)). Adjust the input and output paths as required.
